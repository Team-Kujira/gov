# Kujira Governance

Governance contracts for the Kujira blockchain, forked from [cw-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus). Please see that repository for a detailed breakdown.

These are broken down into two contracts: the CW3 Flex Multisig and the CW4 Group contract, as below.

The only changes made is to enforce a max and min weight for all members, to ensure a quality voting set, see https://github.com/Team-Kujira/gov/commit/696dd6655be9e45379dad533560e37cdd7c8e10e

CW3 Multisig:

- [`cw3-flex-multisig`](./contracts/cw3-flex-multisig) builds on cw3-fixed-multisig,
  with a more powerful implementation of the cw3 spec. It's a multisig contract
  backed by a cw4 (group) contract, which independently maintains the voter set.

CW4 Group:

- [`cw4-group`](./contracts/cw4-group) a basic implementation of the
  [cw4 spec](./packages/cw4/README.md). It handles elected membership, by admin or multisig.
  It fulfills all elements of the spec, including raw query lookups,
  and is designed to be used as a backing storage for [cw3 compliant contracts](./packages/cw3/README.md).
